5. Compare Cloud Costs for a Simple Web Application Across AWS, Azure, and GCP
Comparison

Using the cost models from Section 2:

    AWS: $27.12/month (EC2, RDS, S3, ALB, data transfer).
    Azure: $27.30/month (App Service, MySQL, Blob Storage, Load Balancer, data transfer).
    GCP: $24.63/month (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Load Balancing, data transfer).

Analysis

    Cost: GCP is the cheapest ($24.63), followed by AWS ($27.12) and Azure ($27.30). The difference is minimal (~$2–3), but GCP’s sustained use discounts and Free Tier compute instance contribute to lower costs.
    Features:
        AWS: Offers the most services (e.g., Lambda, AppSync) and scalability options, ideal for complex apps but requires expertise.
        Azure: Best for Microsoft ecosystem integration (e.g., Visual Studio) and hybrid cloud, with a robust Free Tier.
        GCP: Simplest for containerized workloads (e.g., Kubernetes, Cloud Run) and AI/ML, with competitive pricing.
    Ease of Use:
        AWS: Steep learning curve due to extensive options.
        Azure: Moderate, with intuitive portal for Microsoft users.
        GCP: Easiest for small teams due to streamlined services.
    Free Tier:
        AWS: 750 hours of EC2/RDS t3.micro, 5 GB S3.
        Azure: 750 hours of App Service B1, 5 GB MySQL.
        GCP: 1 e2-micro instance (always free), 5 GB Cloud Storage.

Recommendation

GCP is the best choice for a simple web application due to:

    Lowest cost ($24.63/month).
    Free Tier compute instance (e2-micro) covers most needs.
    Sustained use discounts reduce long-term costs.
    Simplicity for small teams deploying containerized or serverless apps. However, if your organization uses Microsoft tools, Azure is preferable for integration. If you need advanced services or anticipate rapid scaling, AWS is ideal despite higher complexity.

Notes for Your Exam

    IAM User Setup: As discussed in the prior response, use an IAM user with AdministratorAccess and no MFA for exam tasks (Solution 1). Ensure you have credentials written down.
    Free Tier: Leverage Free Tier services (e.g., AWS EC2 t3.micro, Azure App Service B1, GCP e2-micro) to minimize costs during the exam.
    Templates: The artifacts provided can be copied into the respective consoles (e.g., IAM policies, pricing calculators) for quick setup.
    Time Management: Prioritize IAM and budget tasks, as they are faster than web app deployment. Practice navigating consoles to locate services quickly.

If you need further clarification or additional artifacts (e.g., web app code, specific policy JSON), let me know! Good luck on your exam!
