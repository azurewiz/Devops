 Got it! You’re essentially building a web app hosted on AWS, using the free tier/student credits, and you want to reach till AWS Lambda integration. I’ll walk you through a step-by-step process assuming the following stack:

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS

Hosting: AWS Amplify (free tier)

Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js/Python/etc.)

API Gateway: To connect frontend to Lambda

Storage (Optional): S3

Authentication (Optional): Cognito

Database (Optional): DynamoDB or RDS


Let’s break this into phases:


---

Phase 1: Prepare Your Web App (Frontend)

1. Create your frontend

Make an HTML file (index.html) along with CSS and JS files if needed.

Example structure:

my-web-app/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js



2. Test locally

Open index.html in your browser to make sure everything works.



3. Zip your app

Select all the files (don’t include the folder), and compress them into webapp.zip.





---

Phase 2: Deploy to AWS Amplify (Hosting)

1. Sign in to AWS Console (https://aws.amazon.com/)

Use your student subscription credentials or AWS free tier account.



2. Go to AWS Amplify

Search for "Amplify" in the AWS console search bar.



3. Create a new app

Choose “Host a web app”

Choose “Deploy without Git provider”



4. Upload the zip file

Upload the webapp.zip and Amplify will host your static website.

It will give you a live URL (like https://main.d1a2b3c4.amplifyapp.com)





---

Phase 3: Create AWS Lambda Function (Backend)

1. Go to Lambda service in AWS Console.


2. Create a new function

Choose Author from scratch

Name your function (e.g., helloWorldFunction)

Runtime: Choose Python 3.12 or Node.js 18 (based on what you code in)

Permissions: Allow it to create a new role with basic Lambda permissions



3. Write your function code

For example (Node.js):

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from Lambda!" }),
    };
};



4. Deploy the function

Click Deploy after writing or editing your code.





---

Phase 4: Set Up API Gateway (to call Lambda from Frontend)

1. Go to API Gateway

Create a new HTTP API



2. Connect it to Lambda

During setup, choose to add an integration with Lambda

Select your Lambda function



3. Deploy the API

You will get an endpoint like https://xyz123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/helloWorldFunction



4. Enable CORS

Under “CORS configuration” allow all origins (*) if testing, or your Amplify URL later.





---

Phase 5: Connect Frontend to Lambda (via API Gateway)

1. Edit your JS file to make a request to the API:

fetch('https://xyz123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/helloWorldFunction')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
      console.log(data.message);
      document.getElementById("output").innerText = data.message;
  });


2. Deploy again

Zip and re-upload the updated files to Amplify or use Amplify CLI/GitHub for continuous deployment.





---

Optional Enhancements

User Authentication: Add Cognito.

Database: Use DynamoDB with Lambda (add permissions to access it).

File Storage: Use S3 and generate presigned URLs via Lambda.

Form Submissions: Send form data from frontend to Lambda via POST request.



---

Would you like me to generate a sample web app + Lambda backend for you, zipped and ready to test on Amplify? Or help with Azure/Azure Static Web Apps + Functions version too?

Great! Let’s tackle this in two parts:


---

Part 1: AWS Lambda (Python Version)

Here’s a basic AWS Lambda function in Python that returns a JSON response:

1. Python AWS Lambda Code

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"  # For CORS
        },
        "body": json.dumps({
            "message": "Hello from AWS Lambda with Python!"
        })
    }

2. Steps to Deploy

Go to AWS Lambda > Create function

Select Python 3.12 runtime

Paste the above code into the code editor

Deploy

Create an API Gateway to expose it over HTTP

Copy the API URL and connect it to your frontend via fetch() in JavaScript



---

Part 2: Azure Static Web App + Azure Function (Python)

Now, let’s move to the Azure student subscription and use Azure Static Web Apps with Azure Functions for backend (like Lambda).


---

Step-by-Step Guide: Azure Static Web App + Python API

1. Set up the Frontend

Use any HTML/CSS/JS files. You can even initialize a simple site like this:

<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Azure Web App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="output">Waiting...</h1>
    <script>
        fetch("/api/hello")
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
              document.getElementById("output").innerText = data.message;
          });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


---

2. Install Azure Static Web Apps CLI (if using locally)

If you're testing locally or deploying via CLI:

npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli


---

3. Azure Function (Python)

Azure Functions need a special folder structure. Here's how:

Folder structure:

my-app/
├── api/
│   └── hello/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── function.json
├── index.html

init.py (Function code):

import logging
import azure.functions as func
import json

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    return func.HttpResponse(
        json.dumps({"message": "Hello from Azure Function!"}),
        status_code=200,
        mimetype="application/json"
    )

function.json:

{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["get"]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}


---

4. Deploy to Azure

Option 1: Deploy using Azure Portal

1. Go to the Azure Portal.


2. Create a Static Web App.


3. Choose deployment method:

GitHub (connect repo)

Or Manual (via Azure CLI or VS Code)




Option 2: VS Code with Azure Static Web Apps Extension

1. Install Azure Static Web Apps extension in VS Code.


2. Sign in to your Azure account.


3. Click "Create Static Web App".


4. Point it to your my-app folder and let it deploy.
