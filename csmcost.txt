(a) AWS Cost Model
Step-by-Step Procedure

    Define Application Architecture
        Compute: EC2 t3.micro (2 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, Free Tier eligible).
        Database: RDS MySQL t3.micro (Free Tier eligible).
        Storage: S3 Standard for static assets (5 GB).
        Networking: Application Load Balancer (ALB) and data transfer (100 GB/month).
    Use AWS Pricing Calculator
        Go to https://calculator.aws/.
        Click Create estimate > add services:
            EC2: Select “EC2 Instances,” choose t3.micro, 750 hours/month (Free Tier), Linux.
            RDS: Select “RDS,” choose MySQL, t3.micro, 750 hours/month, 20 GB storage.
            S3: Select “S3,” Standard storage, 5 GB, 1000 GET requests, 1000 PUT requests.
            ALB: Select “Elastic Load Balancing,” Application Load Balancer, 750 hours, 10 LCUs.
            Data Transfer: Add 100 GB outbound data transfer.
        Save the estimate and note the monthly cost (approximately $10–$15 after Free Tier).
        Calculator Screen Description: The AWS Pricing Calculator interface shows a service selection panel, configuration forms for each service (e.g., instance type, hours, storage), and a summary table with monthly costs. Export options include CSV or sharing links.
    Cost-Benefit Analysis
        Benefits:
            Scalability: EC2 and RDS auto-scaling ensure performance under load.
            Reliability: ALB and S3 provide high availability.
            Free Tier: Minimizes initial costs for prototyping.
        Costs:
            ALB and data transfer are primary cost drivers post-Free Tier.
            Scaling beyond Free Tier increases EC2/RDS costs.
        Trade-offs: Use Spot Instances for EC2 to reduce costs (up to 90% savings) but risk interruptions. Reserved Instances offer 30–50% savings for predictable workloads.

(b) Azure Cost Model
Step-by-Step Procedure

    Define Application Architecture
        Compute: Azure App Service B1 (1 vCPU, 1.75 GB RAM, Free Tier eligible).
        Database: Azure Database for MySQL (Basic tier, 5 GB storage).
        Storage: Blob Storage (Hot tier, 5 GB).
        Networking: Azure Load Balancer and 100 GB data egress.
    Use Azure Pricing Calculator
        Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/.
        Add services:
            App Service: Select “App Service,” choose B1 tier, 720 hours/month (Free Tier).
            MySQL: Select “Azure Database for MySQL,” Basic tier, 5 GB storage.
            Blob Storage: Select “Azure Blob Storage,” Hot tier, 5 GB, 1000 read/write operations.
            Load Balancer: Select “Load Balancer,” Standard tier, 750 hours.
            Data Transfer: Add 100 GB outbound data.
        Save the estimate (approximately $15–$20 after Free Tier).
        Calculator Screen Description: The Azure Pricing Calculator shows a service catalog, configuration panels (e.g., tier, hours, storage), and a cost summary table. Export options include Excel or sharing links.
    Cost-Benefit Analysis
        Benefits:
            Integration: Seamless with Microsoft tools (e.g., Visual Studio).
            Free Tier: App Service and MySQL reduce initial costs.
            Managed Services: App Service simplifies deployment.
        Costs:
            Load Balancer and data egress drive costs post-Free Tier.
            MySQL scaling increases costs for larger workloads.
        Trade-offs: Use Azure Spot VMs for compute to save 60–80% but risk interruptions. Azure Reservations offer 20–40% savings for committed use.
